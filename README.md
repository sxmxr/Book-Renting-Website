# ShaReads : Peer-to-Peer Book-Renting-Website

## Motivation:
* ShaReads is basically going to be a responsive website.
The website is focused on developing a platform for renting
books between the student in their universities. This will
hep students to get books they need at a lower cost and
help in their better education.

## Overview: 
* ShaReads is a responsive web portal through which
students can rent their books across their university.
* It may happen sometimes that students require books
that are not available in the library or have been issued by
some other student.
* In these kinds of situations, ShaReads can turn out to be
a blessing for those students who want the book for a
certain period of time.
* ShaReads provides students a platform to rent the book
from the students across their university and use it.
* ShaReads also provides an option to share the studentâ€™s
book and can also make money out of the rents received.
So the lenders can help the needy students and also can
make money out of it. Lenders will also have the power to
specify the time period and rental amount for their books.
Also if the student desired book is not available then
* ShaReads provide an option of requesting book
availability.
* This feature helps to know which books are in need and if
some students have those books then that student can
immediately lend those books.
ShaReads will also notify their users of the availability of
the needed books via E-Mails.
